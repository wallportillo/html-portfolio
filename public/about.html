<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Walter Portillo. I am from Barranquilla, Colombia, and i represent all the a "barranquillero" is.
  We like to have fun, party an eat. During my upbringing technology was alwys part of my life. My father, a very talented
  maintenance worker for the Power company, always had tools around and taught us how to work with electricity. This curiosity
  for electrics prompted me to study Electrical Engineering
</p>

<p>
  I went to Brigham Young University to study electrical engineering. During this time, I minor in mathematics and focused on 
  Computer Science. I thought that combination of these hard skills with electronics should give me a good shot in the job market.
  I graduated in 2012 from BYU and immediately after graduation I took a job as a Application Engineer for a traffic radar detection
  company. I stayed there for about 5 years wearing many hats to get projects across the globe working. I got pretty good at it
  that I was able to build new implementation of the radar systems to several of the DOTs in the United States helping them imporve 
  traffic detection, analytics and new ways to send information to the cloud for analysis.

<p>When the opportunity came, I switched to be a product manager. I started my career as a PM building Android apps, but I started to move
  towards Web, and platform level development. I moved to a few companies with the main focus on payments. I currently work for PayPal Inc.
  I build their Client SDKs in JavaScript. I always have had an enterprenuer spirit so I am alwasy looking to build something new on my own, or
  creating a product that I am in control of its success.
